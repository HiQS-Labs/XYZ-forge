# RELAY · GH-77 /standup PRD review (Codex sol-high)
<!--
  Single source of truth for this two-agent relay. Read the ENTIRE file before acting.

NEXT: Reviewer
STATUS: Open
ROUND: 1 / 4

## ▶ TAKE YOUR TURN — read this first (works for ANY agent: Claude, Codex, agy)
1. **Read this whole file** (header, Setup, Ground rules, every block in the Log).
2. **Check it's your turn:** `NEXT` (top) names the role to act. Confirm you are bound to it and the
   last Log block isn't already yours. If not → STOP and reply "wrong window — nudge the <other> window."
3. **Do your role's work** on the artifact named in Setup:
   - **Reviewer:** review vs the Definition of Done → graded findings
     (`[Blocker]`/`[Should]`/`[Nit]`/`[Pass]`), each with a concrete fix → set a **Verdict**
     (Approved | Changes requested | Blocked). **Review the whole file, not just the diff** (GH-268):
     a beta test had this loop reach `Approved` in two rounds while an independent audit of the same
     branch found 20 issues (1 critical, 4 high) — every one of them in the pre-existing code the
     change sat on, which nobody had read. Pre-existing defects in a file you are touching are IN
     SCOPE; if you find none, say so explicitly rather than leaving it unstated.
     **Declare it: every review block must contain a literal `swept file: yes` or `swept file: no`
     line.** Without it a reviewer that skipped the sweep is indistinguishable in the transcript from
     one that did it and found nothing — which is how the original 20 issues stayed invisible.
     Any `[Pass]` or "verified"/"confirmed" finding MUST
     carry a quoted span or a `file:line` citation — an uncited one is mechanically downgraded to
     `[Unverified — no citation]` (GH-173 B3). Do **not** edit the artifact; only append findings here.
   - **Producer:** log a disposition for every open finding (Implemented / Modified / Declined + why),
     make the change, then add new work.
4. **Append ONE block** at the very bottom, directly **above** the marker line. Never edit earlier turns.
5. **Update the header:** flip `NEXT`; set `STATUS` (`Approved` closes — Reviewer only; else `Open`);
   the Producer bumps `ROUND` when opening a new cycle. If the max `ROUND` ends without `Approved`,
   set `STATUS: Escalated`.
6. **Commit only the relay file** (`relay(gh77-standup-prd-review-codex): <role> r<N>`); no push. **Stop** and report one line.
7. **Hand off explicitly — EVERY turn, not just the first** (GH-268). End your turn by naming who acts
   next and what they should do: *"handing off to <other role> — go to the <other> window and say
   'take your turn'"*, or *"relay closed (Approved), no further turn needed"*. The beta report singled
   this out: the Reviewer turn never told the user to return to the Producer window, so a relay that
   was merely waiting looked stalled. A turn that ends without this line is not finished.

## Setup
- Artifact under review: `PROJECT/1-INBOX/GH-77-STANDUP-SESSION-TRIAGE.md` — the PRD for a new
  skill, `/standup`. Nothing is built yet; this review is of the **specification**, before any code.
- Reviewer: codex (model `sol`, reasoning effort `high`)   ·   Producer: claude-a
- Started: 2026-08-19
- Context the reviewer needs (read these, they are the design constraints):
  - `skills/radar/SKILL.md`, `skills/10days/SKILL.md`, `skills/releases/SKILL.md` — siblings in this
    repo that `/standup` explicitly defers to or routes into.
  - `~/.claude/skills/finish-line/SKILL.md` and `~/.claude/skills/rabbit-hole/SKILL.md` — the two
    skills whose disciplines this PRD borrows (Mandatory Bar; consolidate-once + interruption budget).
  - `AGENTS.md` → *Repo-specific rails* — the one-marathon-at-a-time rule and the RELEASES DB rails.
  - `RELEASES-DB-FAQS.md` → the drift Q — the incident that motivates the whole PRD.

## Definition of Done — what to grade against

Grade the PRD as a **buildable specification**, not as prose. It passes only if an unfamiliar builder
could implement it without asking the operator a question. Specifically:

1. **The frozen decisions are actually frozen and actually unambiguous.** Four were taken by the
   operator: session+local input scope, park-only write authority, both output halves every run,
   tactical cap of 7. If any is stated in a way that permits two readings, that is a `[Blocker]`.
2. **The interface catalogue is correct.** Every command, flag, rule name, and file path it cites
   must exist. Verify against the repo — `python3 utils/py/releases_app.py --help`, the ROADMAP entry
   format, `utils/pdda/pdda.sh`. **A wrong flag in a catalogue is worse than no catalogue**, because
   the whole point is that the next agent trusts it without checking. Cite `file:line` for anything
   you verify or falsify.
3. **The priority ladder is decidable.** Could two competent agents, handed the same session, produce
   materially different top-3 lists? If the tiers overlap or the tie-breaks are underspecified, say
   exactly where.
4. **The caps are enforceable, not aspirational.** "Hard cap 7" is a claim about behavior. Does the
   PRD say enough for a test to falsify it? Same for the ~5-line strategic section.
5. **The Definition of Done in the PRD is itself testable.** Each bullet should map to something a
   suite can assert. Name any that cannot.
6. **Overlap with the siblings is genuinely resolved.** The PRD claims a gap exists between
   `/finish-line`, `/rabbit-hole`, and `/radar`. Is that true, or does one of them already cover
   this with a different name? A real overlap the PRD papers over is a `[Blocker]`.
7. **Failure modes the PRD does not name.** It is a spec for a skill whose job is to prevent an LLM
   from producing a wall of text and chasing rabbit holes. Where could this skill itself commit
   either sin? Be adversarial here — this is the highest-value part of the review.

Out of scope for this review: the skill's name, the visual/markdown formatting of the eventual chat
output, and anything about GH-75 (the dashboard) beyond whether the PRD's reference to it is accurate.

## Ground rules
1. This file is the single source of truth. The agents never share memory — read the whole file.
2. Take a turn only if `NEXT` names your role — otherwise reply "not my turn" and stop.
3. One turn = one block appended at the very bottom, above the marker. Never edit earlier turns.
4. Stay tight — findings are bullets, not essays. Grade every finding.
5. **The Reviewer never edits the artifact.** It proposes graded findings; the Producer implements.
6. The relay ends on **Approved** (Reviewer only). End each turn by committing just this file; no push.
