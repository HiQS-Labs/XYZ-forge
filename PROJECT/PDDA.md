# Project-Driven Doc Automation (PDDA)

PDDA is the document operating layer for this repo. Its job is to keep project plans, bug-fix docs,
research notes, and roadmap pointers clean enough that an agent can pick up work with minimal drift
and enough structure that routine hygiene can be automated instead of re-decided every session.

The core idea is simple:

- deterministic scripts enforce the parts that should never require judgment
- an LLM reviewer flags structural or planning-quality gaps that are hard to express as regex alone
- `ROADMAP.md` stays a pointer/index, while project detail lives in the individual project docs

## Goals

- Keep `PROJECT/2-WORKING` limited to docs that are truly active.
- Ensure every active doc answers two questions at a glance: what was just completed, and what is next.
- Make phased plans automation-ready by requiring explicit QA gates.
- Prevent plan rot: stale files, missing next steps, hardcoded paths, and hidden scope drift.
- Give agents one repeatable contract for project docs, bug-fix docs, and experimental plans.

## Non-goals

- PDDA does not replace the project docs themselves.
- PDDA does not decide product strategy.
- PDDA does not auto-rewrite nuanced plan content without review.
- PDDA does not turn `ROADMAP.md` into a second execution plan.

## Canonical document model

PDDA assumes four lifecycle buckets:

- `PROJECT/1-INBOX`: new ideas, rough proposals, untriaged notes
- `PROJECT/2-WORKING`: active docs that should be updated as work progresses
- `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED`: completed docs with an outcome
- `PROJECT/4-MISC`: reference, stale, superseded, or abandoned docs

Within that model:

- `ROADMAP.md` is the index of current, completed, attempted, and deferred work
- project detail lives in the individual `PROJECT/**` documents
- a working doc is the canonical source of truth for that effort until it is completed, deferred, or superseded
- `blank.md` placeholders are scaffolding and should be ignored by PDDA checks

## Required contract for active docs

Every doc in `PROJECT/2-WORKING` should have:

1. YAML frontmatter with at least `title`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `owner`, and `goal`
2. a near-top status table with the exact columns:

```md
## Status

| What was just completed | What's next |
|---|---|
| ... | ... |
```

3. clear phase or work sections if the doc is a plan
4. a table of contents (`## Table of contents`) listing each phase, if the plan is multi-phase — so a
   cold agent can see the full phase span and jump to the live one without scrolling the whole body
5. QA gates or acceptance criteria after each phase if the plan is multi-phase
6. for any discovery or spike phase, its findings written **back into this doc** before its QA gate can
   pass (see [Discovery & spike phases](#discovery--spike-phases))
7. repo-relative paths only; no hardcoded absolute local paths

Recommended fields when relevant:

- `related`
- `reviewed`
- `branch`
- `non_goals`
- `gh_issue`
- `effort`, `complexity`, `risk`, `phases` — triage ratings; **required for medium-large work** (see
  [Triage ratings for medium-large work](#triage-ratings-for-medium-large-work))

## Triage ratings for medium-large work

So automation can pick *which* task to pursue without re-reading every plan, every newly recorded
**medium-large** task or project carries four triage fields in its frontmatter:

| Field | Range | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `effort` | integer `1`–`5` | how much work — `1` low, `5` highest |
| `complexity` | integer `1`–`5` | how intricate / how many moving parts — `1` low, `5` highest |
| `risk` | integer `1`–`5` | blast radius + uncertainty — `1` safe/contained, `5` one-way-door or unknown |
| `phases` | positive integer | total number of phases in the plan |

```yaml
effort: 2
complexity: 3
risk: 1
phases: 4
```

`risk` should track the repo's existing reversibility scale (`Easy / Costly / One-way door`,
`AGENTS.md` #3): `1`–`2` ≈ Easy, `3` ≈ Costly, `4`–`5` ≈ one-way door / high uncertainty. It is not a
parallel notion of danger — it is that scale expressed as a number.

**Scope.** Required for medium-large work (project plans, experiments, features, multi-phase efforts).
Genuinely small/trivial docs (a typo, a path repoint, a ≤2–3 line bug-fix — the same floor as the
issue-first SOP) do not need them. "Medium-large" is a judgment, so *presence* is enforced by the LLM
layer, not a regex (below).

### How to combine them — derive, don't store

There is deliberately **no stored composite "score" field.** A frozen aggregate would (a) drift from
the three numbers it came from, violating Principle #4 (*one canonical place per fact*), and (b) bake a
weighting choice into every doc that you then cannot re-tune without rewriting them. Compute the
selection signal **live, at selection time**, from the raw fields:

- **`risk` is a gate, not an addend.** A trivial-but-risky task (`effort 1`, `complexity 1`, `risk 5`)
  is easy to *do* but exactly what automation should not auto-pick — folding risk into a linear sum
  lets it slip through mid-ranked. Gate on it instead.
- **`effort` and `complexity` are correlated** (complex work is usually effortful), so summing them is
  a rough "size" proxy, not two independent signals — treat the sum as one ease axis, not two.

Reference selection rule (tune the thresholds per repo):

```text
eligible      = risk <= 2                 # hard safety gate; risk >= 4 => route to a human
ease          = effort + complexity       # 2..10, lower = easier
pick          = among eligible, lowest ease, then fewest phases as the tiebreak
```

This keeps the raw ratings canonical and queryable while letting the "what's the easiest *safe* thing
to grab" logic live in one place that can evolve. (See the resolved `priority` note under
[Proposed extensions](#proposed-extensions-not-yet-locked).)

### How this is enforced

- **deterministic (values)** — `pdda.sh frontmatter` validates the fields **only when present**:
  `effort`/`complexity`/`risk` must be integers `1`–`5`, `phases` a positive integer. A present-but-bad
  value is unambiguous, so it `error`s. The script does **not** force presence — it cannot know whether
  a doc is "medium-large."
- **LLM (presence)** — `pdda-doc-ready.sh` flags a medium-large plan that is *missing* the triage
  ratings. Whether a doc is medium-large is a judgment, so it stays advisory/warn-capped like every
  other readiness finding.

## Why the two-column status header matters

The status table is the front door for both humans and automation.

- The left column is the last verified state change.
- The right column is the next action.
- If either is missing, an agent has to reconstruct state from the body, which is slow and error-prone.

PDDA therefore treats the exact header names as a contract, not a style preference. The header must be
exactly `What was just completed | What's next` — there is no alias/compatibility window. (One was
specced with a `2026-07-31` cutover, but a single-repo system controls its own docs: no doc here used
an old alias, so a dated, silently-changing branch guarded nothing and was removed 2026-06-22.)

## Discovery & spike phases

Discovery and spike phases exist to *learn* — reverse-engineer an existing system, probe an unknown,
prove or kill a risky approach before committing the plan to it. Their output is knowledge, and under
Principle #1 (*docs are the runtime state, not a record of it*) that knowledge is project state. If it
lives only in an agent's context or a throwaway scratch note, a cold agent resuming the plan cannot see
what was learned, why a path was chosen or abandoned, or what the spike actually proved — and the work
gets re-done.

Contract: **a phase tagged as discovery or spike must write its findings back into the originating plan
doc before its QA gate can pass.** Concretely, that phase's section (or a clearly linked sibling
section in the same doc) must capture:

- **what was investigated** — the system/area reverse-engineered or the question the spike asked
- **what was found** — the concrete mechanics learned, with repo-relative pointers (`file:line`) where
  the finding lives in code, not a vague summary
- **what it changes** — how the finding confirms, redirects, or kills the plan's later phases; an
  unfinished "we'll know after the spike" left dangling is itself the gap

This satisfies Principle #4 (*one canonical place per fact*): the originating plan is that place. A
spike whose findings sit in chat is the exact drift PDDA exists to prevent. The QA gate for a
discovery/spike phase therefore includes "findings are written back to this doc" as an acceptance
criterion alongside the phase's normal checks.

Enforcement is **advisory (LLM layer, warn-capped)** — `pdda-doc-ready.sh` flags a discovery/spike
phase whose findings were not written back. "Did the agent actually capture what it learned" is a
judgment a regex cannot make honestly, so it stays with the LLM reviewer and, like every finding from
that layer, never blocks a build (see [LLM-assisted doc readiness review](#2-llm-assisted-doc-readiness-review)).
To tag a phase, name it plainly (e.g. `## Phase 2 — Discovery: …` / `## Phase 3 — Spike: …`) or set
`doc_type: research` / a phase-level marker the reviewer can see.

## Bug-fix doc stance

Bug-fix docs may use a lighter template than multi-phase project plans, but they still need:

- the minimum frontmatter
- the same `## Status` table while active
- a short bug description
- source of truth for intake, including a GitHub issue when relevant
- verification steps

GitHub issues are the default intake for substantive bug reports (issue-first SOP — see below). They are not a
substitute for the local active-work doc once execution starts in this repo.

## GitHub issue intake

GitHub issues are the **default front door** for substantive work — every project plan and every
non-trivial bug/fix opens an issue *first*, and that issue gets an in-repo pointer doc. The signal
stream lives in GitHub (machine-queryable state, labels, commit↔issue linkage); the execution
surface of record stays in `PROJECT/**`. This is the **issue-first SOP**; the bug-fix stance above
states the principle, and this section owns the *format*. To prevent duplicate intake and forgotten
work, every captured `GH-*.md` doc is also **parked immediately in `ROADMAP.md`** as a one-line queue
entry until it is promoted, deferred, or closed.

**Floor (what needs an issue).** The operational test is **lines of code touched**: any change
beyond a **2–3 line** fix opens a GitHub issue first, and its local plan doc is named after that
issue (see Filename below). Project plans, experiments, and features are always above this line.
**Exempt:** genuinely trivial edits — a ≤2–3 line code fix, a typo, a path repoint, a doc-only
one-liner, formatting — commit directly with a clear message and no issue. When in doubt, open the
issue — it is a cheap `gh issue create`. The SOP applies to *new* efforts going forward; in-flight
`1-INBOX`/`2-WORKING` docs are not backfilled.

Capture a tracked issue as a doc in `PROJECT/1-INBOX/` using this convention:

- **Filename:** `GH-<number>-VERY-SHORT-DESCRIPTION.md` — the local plan doc is always named after
  its GitHub issue (e.g. `GH-1234-SHOWME-COMMAND.md`, `GH-11-CROSS-REPO-TARGETING.md`). Keep the
  description to ~2–4 words; the issue number is the real key, the slug is just a human hint.
  SCREAMING-KEBAB to match the other inbox docs; no zero-padding — mirror the GitHub issue number.
  `<number>` resolves against `origin` (a single canonical repo), so the bare number is unambiguous.
- **Minimum frontmatter:** `gh_issue`, `source` (the full issue URL), `title`, `status`
  (`Proposed (1-INBOX — not yet active)`), `created`, and `doc_type` (`feedback` or `bugfix`).
  For medium-large captures, also include the triage ratings `effort`, `complexity`, `risk`, `phases`
  at capture time, so the queue can be triaged before promotion (see
  [Triage ratings for medium-large work](#triage-ratings-for-medium-large-work)).
- **Body:** transcribe the issue's actionable substance (the asks / acceptance criteria), not the whole
  thread. The live issue stays the discussion surface; this doc is the in-repo capture and back-reference.

Lifecycle:

- The `GH-` inbox doc is the **capture**, not the active-work doc. It carries no `## Status` table while
  it sits in `1-INBOX` (the inbox is the rough/untriaged bucket).
- Capture time also adds a **one-line `ROADMAP.md` queue pointer** linking that inbox doc. This is a
  temporary parking slot: it makes fresh intake visible to humans and automation before promotion,
  which is the duplicate-prevention guard.
- When execution starts, **promote** it to `PROJECT/2-WORKING/` — keep the `GH-` prefix for provenance —
  and it must then satisfy the full active-doc contract (frontmatter, exact status table, QA gates if
  phased), **carrying `gh_issue` forward**. The `ROADMAP.md` pointer is therefore required twice:
  first as a queued parking entry at capture, then as an active-work ledger entry after promotion.
  This is the concrete mechanism behind "GitHub issues are not a substitute for the local active-work
  doc once execution starts" (bug-fix stance above).
- If a captured issue is never actioned it ages out of `1-INBOX` like any other untriaged note; if it is
  closed without work, move the doc to `PROJECT/4-MISC` and remove its queue pointer from `ROADMAP.md`.

A foreign-repo issue (not `origin`) is the rare exception: the `source:` URL disambiguates it, since the
bare `GH-<number>` only guarantees uniqueness within the canonical repo.

## Automation layers

PDDA should have two classes of automation:

Implementation note:

- the automation ships as a single dispatcher, `utils/pdda/pdda.sh`, which sources shared helpers from
  `utils/pdda/pdda-lib.sh`
- every deterministic check is a subcommand: `pdda.sh frontmatter`, `pdda.sh status-table`,
  `pdda.sh hardcoded-paths`, `pdda.sh roadmap`, `pdda.sh roadmap-coverage`, `pdda.sh changelog`,
  `pdda.sh stale`, `pdda.sh issue-doc-sync`
- the aggregate runner is `pdda.sh run` (it runs the deterministic checks in order, then the LLM
  review)
- each finding still carries a stable `check` id (e.g. `pdda-check-frontmatter`) in stdout and the
  activity log, independent of how the check is invoked

### 1. Deterministic hygiene checks

These catch issues where the answer should be the same every time.

#### A. `pdda.sh stale`

Purpose:
- inspect docs in `PROJECT/2-WORKING`
- detect stale docs based on file modification time
- **flag** them for a human to move (this check never moves files itself)

Minimum behavior:
- find docs in `PROJECT/2-WORKING` whose last edit is older than 4 days
- emit a `warn` finding per stale doc recommending the exact `git mv` to `PROJECT/4-MISC`
- honor a `pdda_hold: true` frontmatter override (skip the flag for held docs)
- log every flag to the activity log; **never** auto-move, so this check can never block a build

Why flag-only (design call, 2026-06-22):
- the auto-move was the repo's only destructive mechanic, and the activity log showed it never once
  fired a real move. The value is the flag; the move is risk with no proven payoff — a human runs one
  reversible `git mv`. mtime staleness is a deliberately loose signal, and flag-only makes a wrong
  guess cost nothing but an ignorable line. An opt-in move can be re-added later behind `pdda_hold` +
  `full` mode if it ever earns the miles.

#### B. `pdda.sh status-table`

Purpose:
- verify every doc in `PROJECT/2-WORKING` contains the exact two-column status table

Minimum behavior:
- fail if the `## Status` section is missing
- fail if the table headers are not exactly `What was just completed` and `What's next`
- fail if either first-row cell is blank

#### C. `pdda.sh frontmatter`

Purpose:
- ensure active docs expose the minimum machine-readable metadata

Minimum behavior:
- verify required keys exist
- flag empty required values
- flag invalid or missing dates
- when the triage ratings are present, validate their values — `effort`/`complexity`/`risk` must be
  integers `1`–`5`, `phases` a positive integer (presence itself is judged by the LLM layer; see
  [Triage ratings for medium-large work](#triage-ratings-for-medium-large-work))

#### D. `pdda.sh hardcoded-paths`

Purpose:
- catch absolute machine-specific paths before they fossilize into plans

Minimum behavior:
- scan working docs for obvious absolute paths such as `/Users/`, `/private/`, `/tmp/`, drive-letter paths, or `file://`
- report file + line for each hit

Expected exceptions:
- quoted terminal output
- explicitly marked transcript blocks

#### E. `pdda.sh roadmap`

Purpose:
- enforce the `ROADMAP.md` pointer/ledger contract deterministically (the cheap, hourly guard that
  does not need an LLM), so detail cannot silently leak back into the roadmap

Minimum behavior:
- scan `ROADMAP.md` (override via `PDDA_ROADMAP`)
- `error` on any GFM task-list item (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) — a ledger carries no task checkboxes
- `error` on any `### Checklist` / `### QA checklist` heading — phase/QA detail belongs in the project doc
- `warn` when the file exceeds a line-count / heading-count budget (sprawl signal)

Expected exceptions:
- fenced `console` / `text` / `transcript` blocks and blockquote lines (the carve-out exception note)
  are not scanned — same convention as `pdda.sh hardcoded-paths`

The fuzzy judgment ("deep execution notes that belong elsewhere") stays with the LLM layer below; this
script only catches the unambiguous signals.

#### F. `pdda.sh changelog`

Purpose:
- nudge that `CHANGELOG.md` (the first-class end-of-iteration record) was updated this iteration

Minimum behavior:
- read `CHANGELOG.md` (override via `PDDA_CHANGELOG`); find the newest `## YYYY-MM-DD` entry
- `warn` (never `error` — does not block, even in `full`) when that entry predates the latest git
  commit by more than `PDDA_CHANGELOG_STALE_DAYS` days (default `0`)
- `warn` if `CHANGELOG.md` is missing or has no dated entry; emit `info` (skip the compare) when there
  is no git history

Why warn-only:
- "did you update the changelog" is a reminder, not a correctness gate — blocking a build because a
  human hasn't written the prose yet is the wrong kind of friction (the calibration principle)

#### G. `pdda.sh roadmap-coverage`

Purpose:
- enforce the *coverage* direction of the `ROADMAP.md` contract: every active doc in `PROJECT/2-WORKING`
  must be reflected by a pointer in `ROADMAP.md`, so the ledger can never silently fall behind the
  working set. This is the inverse of `pdda.sh roadmap` (which keeps execution detail from leaking
  *into* the roadmap); together they guard the pointer/working-set relationship in both directions.

Minimum behavior:
- list the working docs (`PROJECT/2-WORKING/*.md`, `blank.md` excluded)
- `error` on any working doc whose repo-relative path (`PROJECT/2-WORKING/<name>.md`) does not appear in
  `ROADMAP.md` (override the roadmap location via `PDDA_ROADMAP`) — the action is "add a one-line ledger
  entry linking it"
- `error` if `ROADMAP.md` is missing entirely

Expected exceptions:
- a working doc that should not appear in the ledger opts out with `roadmap_exempt: true` in its
  frontmatter (mirrors the `pdda_hold` escape hatch in `pdda.sh stale`); the check then
  emits `info` (skip) for that doc

#### H. `pdda.sh issue-doc-sync`

Purpose:
- catch a `PROJECT/2-WORKING/GH-*.md` doc whose recorded state has drifted from its **GitHub issue**,
  in either direction — the gap a 2026-06-29 manual reconciliation pass had to cross-reference by hand

Minimum behavior:
- for each working doc, resolve its issue number from the `gh_issue` frontmatter key (preferred) or the
  `GH-<number>-` filename; silently skip docs that carry neither (they are not issue-tracked)
- resolve each issue's state from the best available source (see gh-degrade below), then flag two drifts:
  - **(a)** issue **CLOSED** but the doc is still in `2-WORKING` -> `warn`, recommending the exact
    `git mv` to `PROJECT/3-COMPLETED` (flag-only; a human runs the one reversible move)
  - **(b)** issue **OPEN** but the doc's `status:` lead word declares it done (`complete`, `done`,
    `shipped`, `fixed`, `closed`, `merged`, `resolved`, `landed`) -> `warn` to reconcile (close the
    issue or correct the status). Anchoring on the status **lead word** means a mid-status mention like
    `Active — Phase 0 complete` never false-flags.
- `warn` (never `error` — does not block, even in `full`, mirroring `pdda.sh changelog`); **flag-only**,
  never moves a file
- gh-degrade: with `PDDA_ISSUE_SYNC_SOURCE=auto` (default) it uses live `gh` when that succeeds, else a
  cached state file (`PDDA_GH_STATE_CACHE`, written by `pdda-gh-refresh.sh`); when neither is available
  it emits `info` (skip) for the affected doc and evaluates nothing. `gh`/`cache` force one source.

Why warn-only + flag-only:
- every drift class here is mechanical, so the check carries zero false-judgment risk; a false flag is
  one ignorable warn line and a missed flag just leaves today's manual reconciliation — both cheap, so
  warn-only never-blocks is the right calibration (same stance as `pdda.sh stale` and `pdda.sh changelog`)

### 2. LLM-assisted doc readiness review

This catches the issues where structure exists but planning quality is weak.

#### `pdda-doc-ready.sh`

Purpose:
- review active project plans and flag docs that are not ready for reliable automation

It should check for:

- phased plans missing QA gates after a phase
- phase sections with actions but no observable acceptance criteria
- multi-phase plans missing a table of contents listing each phase
- discovery or spike phases whose findings were not written back into the plan doc
- medium-large plans missing the triage ratings (`effort`, `complexity`, `risk`, `phases`)
- status tables that are technically present but stale versus the body
- docs that bury the next action in prose instead of making it explicit
- plans that duplicate detail already meant to live in another canonical doc
- contradictory status, such as frontmatter saying `Completed` while the body says active

It should not:

- auto-rewrite the plan body without review
- invent technical claims not grounded in the doc
- silently override deterministic lints
- **block a build.** The LLM layer is advisory: its findings are capped at `warn` (any model `error`
  is clamped to `warn` in `pdda-doc-ready.sh`), so a non-deterministic oracle can never fail a build —
  the same doc must not pass at 2pm and fail at 3pm. Only deterministic checks earn blocking power.

### 3. Doc-health hooks (event-triggered delivery)

The deterministic checks above can also run automatically from Claude Code hooks, as a two-tier
doc-health system. The hooks are pure **delivery** — they run the SAME section-1 checks on a trigger;
they add no new analysis class. Both are **warn-only and fail-open: they always exit `0` and can never
block** an edit or a stop (a doc-hygiene reminder is never worth interrupting work — the calibration
principle, same as `pdda.sh changelog`).

- **Tier 1 — `pdda-edit-doc-hook.sh` (`PostToolUse` on `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`).** Reads the edited
  `tool_input.file_path`; exits `0` instantly unless it is `ROADMAP.md` or a `PROJECT/**/*.md` doc;
  otherwise runs the fast **local single-file** subset for just that file — `frontmatter`,
  `status-table`, `hardcoded-paths`, `roadmap-coverage` (and `roadmap` for `ROADMAP.md`), scoped via
  `PDDA_ONLY_FILE`. **No network, no `gh`, no LLM**, so it stays instant and cannot gate an edit.
- **Tier 2 — Stop full-scan (`pdda-stop-doc-health.sh`).** The companion that runs one consolidated,
  system-wide doc-health scan per turn (the deterministic suite plus `issue-doc-sync` against the
  cached gh-state file). See [Suggested Stop doc-health scan](#suggested-stop-doc-health-scan).

`PDDA_ONLY_FILE=<path>` is the seam that scopes any check to a single file (unset = full scan, the
default everywhere else). Wiring is repo-local in `.claude/settings.json`; installs receive the hook
scripts via the manifest and opt in by adding the hook entries.

#### Suggested Stop doc-health scan

Tier 2's `pdda-stop-doc-health.sh` runs **one** system-wide scan per turn and prints a **single
consolidated report**:

- it runs the deterministic suite with `PDDA_ISSUE_SYNC_SOURCE=cache`, so `issue-doc-sync` reads the
  cached gh-state file (written by `pdda.sh gh-refresh`) and the scan makes **no network call**;
- it runs in `observe` mode with the LLM layer disabled — purely deterministic, fast, offline;
- it aggregates the run into one report: a header with the error/warn totals, then the warn/error
  finding lines (an `all clear` line when there are none);
- it **always exits `0`** (proven by `test/pdda-doc-health-hooks.sh`), so it can never block a stop.

Wire it as a `Stop` hook in `.claude/settings.json` (no matcher). Because it reads the cache rather
than calling `gh`, keep `pdda.sh gh-refresh` on the hourly cadence so the Stop report stays current.

## Enforcement modes

PDDA runs in one of three modes. The mode is resolved in this order: **the `PDDA_MODE` env var wins if
set; otherwise the first non-comment line of a repo-root `.pdda-mode` file; otherwise the built-in
default `observe`.** (So an env var overrides a committed `.pdda-mode` — convenient for a one-off
`PDDA_MODE=observe` pass against a repo otherwise committed to `full`.) The point is an **adoption
ramp**: a freshly-installed PDDA should never break a build on day one, and a project should graduate
onto the rails deliberately.

| Mode | When | Findings reported | Exit on `error` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `observe` | just installed | yes | always `0` |
| `light` | transitioning | yes | `0` (warn, don't block) |
| `full` | fully on rails | yes | non-zero (blocks) |

- The default is `observe` so a brand-new install is non-blocking — it shows the team what PDDA
  *would* flag without failing anything.
- `light` is the transition phase: loud reports, but still never fails a build, while the backlog of
  doc debt is cleared.
- `full` is the strict end state: `error` findings block with a non-zero exit. A repo declares it by
  committing `.pdda-mode` with `full`.
- **No mode mutates the tree.** Stale docs are *flagged, never auto-moved* — the only destructive
  mechanic was removed (see the stale-doc check above). Mode controls one thing only: whether an
  `error` blocks. Every check ends with `exit "$(pdda_gated_exit "$EXIT_CODE")"`, which returns the
  real code only in `full`.

## ROADMAP.md contract

`ROADMAP.md` is a pointer file, not a plan body.

It should contain:

- queued / parked intake pointers for newly captured `GH-*.md` docs
- projects in progress
- completed work
- attempted work
- deferred work
- links to the canonical project docs

It should usually not contain:

- detailed phase checklists
- step-by-step build instructions
- deep execution notes already owned by a project file

Strict exemption:
- a short exception note is allowed when omitting the note would hide an operationally critical fact

Maintainer rule:
- when a roadmap entry needs more than a one-line status + a link, that is the signal to put the
  detail in the entry's `PROJECT/**` doc and leave only the pointer here — do not grow the roadmap

Coverage rule:
- every active doc in `PROJECT/2-WORKING` must be reflected here by a pointer (a one-line ledger entry
  that links it), so the ledger never falls behind the working set. A working doc that legitimately
  should not appear opts out with `roadmap_exempt: true` in its frontmatter. This is the inverse of the
  "no detail leaks in" rule above: nothing active goes *missing from* the roadmap either.
- every captured GitHub issue doc in `PROJECT/1-INBOX/GH-*.md` must also be reflected here as a
  one-line **queued / parked** pointer until it is promoted, deferred out, or closed, so intake cannot
  quietly disappear and later be duplicated.

How this is enforced (so it cannot quietly rot in either direction):
- **deterministic (no leak in)** — `pdda.sh roadmap` errors on task checklists / `### Checklist` /
  `### QA checklist` headings and warns on size sprawl (runs hourly, free, no model needed)
- **deterministic (no gap missing)** — `pdda.sh roadmap-coverage` errors when either an
  active `PROJECT/2-WORKING` doc has no pointer here, or a captured `PROJECT/1-INBOX/GH-*.md` doc is
  not parked here as a queue entry (honors `roadmap_exempt: true`)
- **LLM** — `utils/pdda/pdda-doc-ready.sh` reviews `ROADMAP.md` against the full pointer contract for the
  fuzzier "this paragraph is really execution detail" cases (honors the carve-out)
- the file itself carries a top banner restating the contract, so a human editing it sees the rule

## CHANGELOG.md — end-of-iteration record (first-class)

`CHANGELOG.md` is a first-class PDDA artifact: the canonical, newest-first running log of what changed,
updated **at the end of each iteration**. It replaces `RECAP.md` (retired → `PROJECT/4-MISC/`) as the
running provenance/narrative log. `REAL-AGENT-OBSERVATIONS.md` still holds run-specific compliance
findings, and durable Costly / one-way-door bets still earn a `decisions/` record.

It should contain:

- newest-first, dated `## YYYY-MM-DD` sections
- one entry per substantive iteration: what changed, why, and the verification (test / suite result)
- the bet behind a consequential change when one applies (the call, the expected signal, reversibility)

It should not contain:

- per-file diffs or deep execution detail that belongs in the entry's `PROJECT/**` doc
- aspirational plans — those live in the project doc and the `ROADMAP.md` ledger

Maintained append-only:

- add a new dated entry per iteration; **never rewrite a past entry's numbers, claims, or
  recommendation** — *especially* not when it turned out wrong. Correct a past entry by appending a
  dated correction, not by editing history. This is the provenance guarantee `RECAP.md` used to carry.

Recording a bet (when a change is consequential):

- when a decision is Costly, a one-way door, or rides on an assumption that could be wrong, the entry
  records the call, the bet/assumption, the expected signal with a by-when, the reversibility read, a
  revisit trigger, and a graduate / iterate / abandon recommendation. Below that threshold a plain
  entry suffices. Durable bets also earn a `decisions/` record; run-specific compliance findings go in
  `REAL-AGENT-OBSERVATIONS.md`. (`AGENTS.md` principle #7 supplies the behavioral trigger — *record the
  bet*; this contract owns the *where and how*, so governance is not fragmented across the two files.)

How this is enforced (a nudge, not a gate):
- **deterministic** — `pdda.sh changelog` **warns** (never `error`, so it never blocks —
  even in `full`) when the newest dated entry predates the latest git commit by more than
  `PDDA_CHANGELOG_STALE_DAYS` days (default `0`), i.e. an iteration shipped without a changelog entry
- whether an entry is actually *substantive* stays a human / LLM judgment, not a regex

## Activity log artifact

PDDA should write an append-only activity log to:

- `PROJECT/PDDA-ACTIVITY.jsonl`

Each script run should append:

- per-finding entries
- one summary entry for the script
- enough metadata to tell what moved, what failed, and when

## Suggested hourly schedule

Run the deterministic checks every hour in this order:

1. `pdda.sh frontmatter`
2. `pdda.sh status-table`
3. `pdda.sh hardcoded-paths`
4. `pdda.sh roadmap`
5. `pdda.sh roadmap-coverage`
6. `pdda.sh changelog`
7. `pdda.sh stale`
8. `pdda.sh issue-doc-sync`

Then run:

9. `pdda.sh doc-ready`

(`pdda.sh run` runs exactly this sequence and applies the active `PDDA_MODE` gate. Scheduling the
single aggregate command is the recommended hourly cron entry.)

The cached GitHub issue-state refresh is a separate, network-only step. Run `pdda.sh gh-refresh`
(the standalone `utils/pdda/pdda-gh-refresh.sh`) on the same hourly cron/launchd cadence, **before**
the suite, so `issue-doc-sync` and the Stop doc-health scan read fresh state. It is the only step that
needs `gh`/the network; it writes `PDDA_GH_STATE_CACHE` atomically and leaves the existing cache
untouched on any `gh` failure, so the suite itself stays offline-tolerant by reading the cache.

Reason for the order:

- deterministic failures should surface first
- the network-dependent `issue-doc-sync` runs last among the deterministic checks, so every local
  check still completes when `gh` is offline (it then degrades to the cache or an `info` skip)
- the LLM review should spend time only on docs that passed basic structural hygiene

## Suggested output contract

To make these scripts composable, each should emit:

- a short human-readable summary to stdout
- a machine-readable result format, ideally JSON lines
- non-zero exit when blocking issues are found

Suggested fields per finding:

- `severity`
- `check`
- `file`
- `line`
- `message`
- `action`
- `timestamp`

Severity proposal:

- `error`: automation-blocking
- `warn`: should be fixed soon but not blocking
- `info`: advisory only

## Readiness rubric for automation

A doc is "automation ready" when:

- it is in the correct lifecycle folder
- it has valid frontmatter
- it has the exact status table
- the next action is singular and explicit
- each phase has a visible QA gate
- a multi-phase plan has a table of contents listing its phases
- any discovery or spike phase has its findings written back into the doc
- links to canonical related docs are present where needed
- there are no hardcoded absolute paths
- `ROADMAP.md` is pointing at it rather than duplicating it

## Failure modes PDDA is trying to prevent

- active docs with no visible next step
- too many half-live docs in `PROJECT/2-WORKING`
- plans that look complete but have no verification gates
- stale working docs silently lingering forever
- roadmap sprawl where detail leaks into `ROADMAP.md`
- agent sessions restarting the same reasoning because the doc never captured "what changed"

## Proposed extensions not yet locked

These are likely useful for full automation, but they are still policy choices:

- a `doc_type` field such as `project`, `bugfix`, `research`, `feedback`, `roadmap`
- ~~a `priority` field if you want deterministic triage beyond folder placement~~ **superseded** by the
  `effort`/`complexity`/`risk`/`phases` [triage ratings](#triage-ratings-for-medium-large-work), which
  give richer triage than a single priority scalar — automation derives the selection signal from them
  rather than storing one frozen number
- a `pdda_hold: true` override for docs that should remain in `2-WORKING` despite inactivity
- a second generated PDDA summary artifact beyond the activity log

## Open questions

These need a decision before the automation should be considered stable:

1. Should `PROJECT/PDDA-ACTIVITY.jsonl` remain append-only forever, or rotate by month once the volume grows?
2. Should `ROADMAP.md` remain root-level canonical only, or do you also want a project-local roadmap index under `PROJECT/`?

Resolved:

- ~~Should the compatibility window end on `2026-07-31`, or be shorter/longer?~~ **Resolved
  2026-06-22:** removed entirely. No doc in the repo used an old alias, so a dated cutover guarded
  nothing — and a script whose behavior changes silently on a hardcoded date is the same fossilized
  assumption the hardcoded-path check exists to prevent. Headers are now exact-or-`error`, no window.
- ~~Should `gh_issue` stay optional metadata, or become required for bug-fix docs that originated from
  GitHub?~~ **Resolved 2026-06-21:** `gh_issue` stays optional in general, but is **required** on any
  doc that originated from a GitHub issue — which the `GH-<number>-…` filename guarantees. See
  [GitHub issue intake](#github-issue-intake).

## Recommended v1 stance

If the goal is "get project docs onto rails quickly," the safest v1 is:

- start in `observe` mode, then graduate `light` → `full` as the doc backlog is cleared
- enforce exact status-table headers (no alias window)
- require QA gates on phased plans
- forbid hardcoded absolute paths
- run deterministic checks hourly
- let the LLM reviewer flag readiness issues
- keep `ROADMAP.md` pointer-only (deterministic `pdda.sh roadmap` + the LLM rubric guard it)
- append all script activity to `PROJECT/PDDA-ACTIVITY.jsonl`
