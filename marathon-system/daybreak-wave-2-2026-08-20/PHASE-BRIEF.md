# Daybreak · Wave 2 — session transcript, RELEASES CLI, PARKED (still offline)

Release **0.7.2 "Daybreak"** · marathon `mar-01M0EC2ZXJCCJ88KASQPDBTBJ9` · tracking
[#77](https://github.com/HiQS-Labs/XYZ-forge/issues/77).

Build lenses **1, 6, 8** in `skills/standup/collect.sh`. Wave 1 (lenses 2, 3, 7) is already landed
and green — `test/gh77-standup-triage.sh` runs 92/0 on `development`. These three complete the
offline set before the two `gh` lenses arrive in wave 3; none of them touches the network or `gh`.

## Work units

| Issue | Lens | Bounded read |
|---|---|---|
| [#82](https://github.com/HiQS-Labs/XYZ-forge/issues/82) | 1 · conversation | this session's transcript — an action the agent said it would take, or a finding it raised, neither completed nor parked |
| [#83](https://github.com/HiQS-Labs/XYZ-forge/issues/83) | 6 · RELEASES ledger | `$R check`, `$R next`, then `$R list --status draft` + `--status active` to enumerate, then `$R show --version <v>` per enumerated release |
| [#84](https://github.com/HiQS-Labs/XYZ-forge/issues/84) | 8 · PARKED | read `PARKED/*.md` — a parked record whose mandatory `check` field (a read-only probe, never the `close` command) reports the work is done |

## Contract (unchanged from wave 1)

`collect.sh --fixture <dir>` must emit one JSON document:

```json
{"repo": {"branch": "<name>"},
 "lenses": {"6": {"status": "ok|degraded", "degraded_id": "D<n>|null", "candidates": [ … ]}}}
```

`triage.py --lenses <file> --dry-run` is the consumer. Read it — it is the authority on field names
and on what each lens's `live_state` payload must contain, because suppression hashes that payload.

## Pass condition — machine-checkable, per unit

```
skills/standup/collect.sh --fixture skills/standup/fixtures/lens-<n>   # valid JSON
python3 skills/standup/triage.py --lenses <that output> --dry-run      # no D5, exit 0
bash test/gh77-standup-triage.sh                                       # green
```

## Things that are already settled — do not relitigate them

- **Lens 6 classifies corruption from BOTH emission shapes**, `FAIL: rule=` and `warn: rule=` —
  matching only `warn:` made the founding incident class produce no candidate at all. The
  corruption rule set routes to tier 1; an `active` release past target is the non-corruption row.
- **Lens 8 runs only the park record's read-only `check` probe.** `close` is never executed during
  collection — closing interfaces are rendered for the operator, not run.
- **Lens 1 evidence is `quote:<span>`** — the normalized quoted span, identical to the key's input,
  staleness age 0. No transcript enumeration beyond this session.
- **`triage.py` is NOT modified by this phase** — if a lens seems to need a change there, that is a
  finding to report, not an edit to make.

## Definition of done for this phase

All three lenses implemented, three fixture directories under `skills/standup/fixtures/lens-<n>/`
(plus degradation fixtures matching the wave-1 pattern), each lens degrades loudly with its `D<n>`
id when its read is unavailable, new assertions in `test/gh77-standup-triage.sh`, and
`bash validate.sh --subsystem releases` green.

## Working rules for the BUILDER — wave 1 escalated once; these are its lessons

- **`skills/standup/fixtures/` is a DIRECTORY lane** — spelled with the trailing slash, so the whole
  tree beneath it is yours this turn. Wave 1's first fire spelled it without one, which was
  unmatchable by construction and reverted the fixtures as off-lane (GH-90, fixed in `a350b2d`).
- **Do not leave scratch files in the tree.** Probe files, scratch scripts, and one-off outputs are
  off-lane no matter how harmless, and a single stray path at the repo root fails the whole turn.
  Use `$TMPDIR`.
- **Off-lane edits are reverted by the harness.** A `### Side Finding` block in the relay file is
  the only channel that survives — path / symptom / suspected_cause / probe.

## What this phase is actually testing

Three lanes editing **one shared `collect.sh` and one shared suite**. That collision surface is why
this is a marathon rather than a task. A lane clobbering another's edit, a stale worktree, an
unexpected driver-lock interaction — those are the deliverable, per `AGENTS.md` → Repo-specific
rails, rule 4. **Report what broke; do not smooth it.** A clean run that teaches nothing is the
weaker result.
