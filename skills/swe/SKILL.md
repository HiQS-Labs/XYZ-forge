description: Apply an opinionated software-engineering governance lens to a build/spec/PRD document — especially a "build v1.x" doc — so the plan enforces minimal scope, designs for diagnosis, accounts for blast radius, and is verifiable before anyone writes code. Use this when authoring or reviewing a v1.x build plan, implementation spec, architecture doc, RFC, or AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, or when the user says "write a project plan," "write a plan," "review this build doc," "apply our SWE standards," "make this plan production-grade," "gate this spec," "is this plan ready to build," "bake in our engineering philosophy," or pastes a plan and asks whether it embodies good engineering discipline. Also self-trigger before drafting a v1.x build document or any project plan so the standards shape it from the first draft instead of being bolted on after. This is the standard (the rubric), not the pipeline — it supplies the engineering invariants a plan is checked against.

# SWE

Vibe the build; engineer the plan. This lens is the discipline that lets a fast v1.x ship without becoming a liability.

A governance overlay for **build/spec documents** — the "build v1.x" doc, the implementation spec, the architecture RFC. It does not debug code or pick a tradeoff in the moment; it reads the *plan* and asks whether the plan already embodies the engineering standards before a single line is written. Run it two ways: as an **authoring gate** (write the doc against it) or as a **review rubric** (read a doc, emit findings + a verdict). The whole bet: most plans fail not on the feature but on the four things below, smuggled past in prose.

## The four pillars

Each pillar is a lens on the document. A v1.x doc that satisfies a pillar contains the thing explicitly; a doc that "implies" it fails the pillar — implied is unbuilt.

### 1. Minimal (Ponytail) — does the plan earn each part it adds?

The plan's default answer to "add a thing" is *no*. Scope, dependencies, and abstractions are all liabilities until justified in the doc.

- [ ] Every new component answers "does this need to exist?" (YAGNI) — speculative scope is cut or deferred, not built.
- [ ] Sourcing ladder is honored to minimize mechanism, not requirements: stdlib → native platform feature → already-installed dep → one line of our own. A new dep names what it buys that the rung above does not. (Security and observability requirements are never simplified away, only implemented via the laziest viable mechanism).
- [ ] No premature abstraction — the plugin layer / framework / generic engine is justified by ≥2 concrete present uses, not one hypothetical future one.
- [ ] Bias is stated: delete > add, boring > clever, shortest diff that works. A complexity cap is named (e.g. stdlib-only, ~600-line ceiling) where it applies.

*Planning translation:* this is the editor pass on scope. Most v1.x bloat is decided here, in the doc, long before code.

### 2. Diagnosable (Mantra) — does the plan say how it will fail and be found?

A build doc that provisions zero observability is a debugging session deferred to production. Bake the diagnosis path into v1.x, not v1.next.

- [ ] Instrumentation is right-sized but explicit: a single actionable error log is better than an unread ELK stack, but silent failures are blocked. The plan names the exact log, metric, or alert that fires when it breaks.
- [ ] Every iterate/retry loop has a **stop condition** (e.g. 5-failure hard stop, 10-total cap). An unbounded "retry until it works" is a defect in the plan.
- [ ] Failures are made reproducible: the plan names how a failure is repro'd, and treats intermittent failure as a *signal* (concurrency / ordering / env / TOCTOU), not noise to retry away.
- [ ] State changes are auditable — append-only event log over in-place mutation where the history matters.
- [ ] **The plan names debug-mantra as its execution-time debugging protocol** — "we'll figure it out when it breaks" is a Diagnosable failure.

*Planning translation:* the runtime debugging ritual, pulled forward. If the doc can't say how you'll see it break, you'll see it break in prod.

### 3. Blast — does the plan price its irreversible moves before committing?

For every wide-impact or hard-to-undo step, the doc must already carry the cost. Don't dress a one-way door as a tweak.

- [ ] Each risky step names its **undo class**: easy / costly / one-way door. One-way doors are flagged, never silent.
- [ ] **Blast radius** is named — the exact systems, data, and people that break if this step goes wrong (not "various downstream").
- [ ] A **shield** is specified — flag, adapter, pilot/canary, dual-write, or an explicit "none."
- [ ] A **tripwire** exists for anything costly or one-way: *how* you'll know to pull it and *by when* (the point of no return). A shield with no tripwire is a brake with no warning light.

For the full per-decision accounting, defer to the **blast-radius** skill — this pillar only enforces that the v1.x doc *contains* that accounting for its irreversible steps.

### 4. Proof (Done) — can the plan prove it's finished, separately from claiming it?

Editor and grader are different roles. The plan must define "done" in terms something other than the author can check.

- [ ] Every task has a **measurable done-criterion** — a checkable output or metric, not "works" / "improved" / "robust."
- [ ] Tests are specified *and the plan requires they actually run* — "tests pass" means an execution artifact, not an assertion.
- [ ] **No orphan tasks**: every step maps to a success criterion, and every success criterion is covered by a step.
- [ ] **Closed loop**: For medium/large efforts, backend/data work must explicitly connect to a user-facing UI plane or final consumer. Fetching data without surfacing it to the user is an incomplete loop.
- [ ] **Observed vs. predicted is kept separate** — the doc never launders a projection ("this will reduce load 40%") as evidence. Predictions are labeled as such.

*Planning translation:* PlanProof's editor/grader separation at document scale. The grader reads only what's written, not what the author meant.

## House invariants

Non-negotiable conventions a v1.x doc must satisfy regardless of pillar. These are cheap to check and expensive to skip.

- [ ] **FSM threshold** — model an explicit state machine only past ~4 states; below that a flag or enum is leaner. Past it, an ad-hoc tangle of booleans is the defect.
- [ ] **Single write path** — one writer per piece of state. Multiple write paths to the same table/file are a race waiting to happen; name the single path.
- [ ] **Append-only event log** only when audit or history is an explicit business requirement (JSONL or equivalent); otherwise, simple in-place updates are the default.
- [ ] **UTC-only** time handling end to end; local time only at the display edge. "Nightly," "daily," "expires in 24h" all imply a timezone — pin it.
- [ ] **Crash-safe / idempotent jobs** — cron and background work are resumable and safe to run twice. A job that corrupts state on a mid-run crash is unshipped.
- [ ] **Checklist standard** — actionable items use the `- [ ]` hyphen prefix in GitHub-flavored Markdown, never bare `[ ]` in tables or lists.
- [ ] **Agent contract current** — for agent-built work, AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md exists and matches the plan (conventions, loop caps, honesty constraints). The project's AGENTS.md must name SOLID compliance as a coding standard; if it doesn't, the plan has no enforceable code-design contract.

## How this differs from the sibling skills

- **swe** — "Does this *plan* embody our engineering standards before we build?" The standard/rubric, applied to a whole document.
- **plan-adversarial-serial** — the *pipeline* (generate → review → revise → review → judge). It is the machinery; `swe` is one of the standards the machinery can enforce. Compose them: run the adversarial pipeline with `swe` as the lens content.
- **blast-radius** — "How big is *this one decision* and what breaks?" `swe`'s Blast pillar defers per-decision accounting to it.
- **iron-triangle** — "Which of speed/cost/quality is *this choice* trading?" When a plan forces fast/cheap/good tension, hand that node to it.
- **debug-mantra** — the four-step runtime debugging discipline (reproduce → fail path → falsify → breadcrumb). Diagnosable enforces the plan names it; debug-mantra governs live execution — composing across the doc/session boundary.
- **take-a-step-back** — "Is this the right problem/frame at all?" Runs *before* there is a plan to govern.
- **bottom-line** / **linear** — compress or sequence output. `swe` evaluates a plan's substance; those reshape its presentation.

Reach for `swe` the moment there is a build/spec document to hold to a standard — authoring one or judging one.

## How to apply

**Author mode** — you are writing the v1.x doc. Use the four pillars and house invariants as the doc's skeleton: each feature passes Minimal before it earns a section; each risky step ships with its Blast block; each task ships with its Proof criterion. The lens is the gate, not a later edit.

**Review mode** — you are handed a v1.x doc. Walk the four pillars then the invariants. For each gap, emit one finding keyed to the doc location (`§section`, or `file:line` for code-adjacent specs), tagged by severity, with the *cheapest* fix first. Close with a verdict. Do not rewrite the doc unless asked — surface the checkable gaps and let the author act.

## Project plan scaffold (Author mode)

When the ask is "write a project plan" / "write a plan" (authoring, not reviewing), build the doc against the four pillars **and** lay it out in the fixed structure below. The structure is load-bearing, not decoration: the status table forces an honest "where are we" at a glance, the Table of contents keeps a long plan navigable, observable checklist items *are* the Proof done-criteria, and the per-phase QA checklist is the grader pass made mechanical. Implied is unbuilt — so every field below is written down, not assumed.

Required order, top to bottom: **frontmatter → status table → table of contents → phases (each with observable todos) → per-phase QA checklist**.

### Phase 1 — QA checklist
- [ ] Every todo above produced its checkable output (no orphan tasks)
- [ ] Tests written **and run** — point to the execution artifact, not an assertion
- [ ] Diagnosable: logs + correlation id present; every loop has a stop condition
- [ ] Blast: each risky step names undo-class + shield + tripwire (or explicit "none")
- [ ] Status table and `updated:` date refreshed before this phase is marked done

## Phase 2: <name>
...
````

Filling it:

- **Frontmatter** — the at-a-glance contract. Keep `status`, `updated`, and `reversibility` honest; a stale `updated` date is the first sign the plan drifted from reality.
- **Status table** — exactly two columns, one row. It is the single source of truth for "where are we"; update it as the *last* step of finishing a phase, never before. Don't expand it into a multi-row log — that's what phases are for.
- **Phases** — split by observable milestone, not by calendar. Apply the Minimal pillar to phase count too: only as many phases as the work earns. Each phase has one `**Goal:**` line stating the outcome it delivers.
- **Observable todos** — every `- [ ]` names a checkable output, not an activity. "Add retry cap of 5 to the reconciler loop" passes; "improve reliability" fails. Use the `- [ ]` hyphen prefix (house Checklist standard), never bare `[ ]`.
- **Per-phase QA checklist** — closes each phase against the four pillars. It is Proof's editor/grader separation per phase: the boxes are checked by running things, not by the author asserting done. A phase isn't complete until its QA checklist is.

## Output format (Review mode)

Lead with the verdict in one line. Then findings, ordered by severity, then quick wins first within a severity. Keep it tight — clean plans get a short list, not a manufactured one.

**Verdict:** **Ship** · **Ship with conditions** · **Block** — [one sentence: the load-bearing reason].

**Findings:**

| Loc | Pillar | Severity | What breaks | Cheapest fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| §x.y | Blast | Block | One-way migration with no rollback named | Add a dual-write window + a row-count tripwire before cutover |
| §x.z | Proof | Fix | "Improves sync" has no done-criterion | State the measurable signal (e.g. drift count → 0 over 3 runs) |

Severity: **Block** (cannot build safely as written — unguarded one-way door, no done-criteria, unbounded loop) · **Fix** (change before v1.x ships) · **Note** (improvement, optional).

**Quick wins:** [the 1–3 findings fixable in a line of doc, listed as `- [ ]` so the author can tick them off.]

## Principles

**Implied is unbuilt.** A plan gets credit only for what it states. "Obviously we'll log it" is a Diagnosable failure; write it down or it won't exist.

**Editor and grader are different roles.** The strongest constraint in the whole lens is Proof's separation: done is defined by something the author can't fudge. Keep them apart.

**Price the one-way doors loudest.** Reversible mistakes are cheap; irreversible ones are the only ones worth slowing down for. A tweak that can't be undone is not a tweak.

**Cut scope before breaking a corner.** When the plan is overloaded, the Minimal pillar and scope-reduction beat heroics. Defer to `iron-triangle` when the tension is explicitly fast/cheap/good.

**Stop conditions are not optional.** Any loop in the plan — retry, fix-iterate, agent relay — names its cap. Unbounded means undefined.

**Separate what you saw from what you expect.** Observed evidence and predicted behavior are different epistemic objects; a plan that blends them is lying to its future reader.

**Don't manufacture findings.** A genuinely clean v1.x doc gets "Ship" and a short list. The lens enforces a standard, not a quota of objections.

## Example — reviewing a v1.x build doc excerpt

Input (abridged):

> **§3 Nightly order reconciler.** A cron job runs each night to reconcile order state against the upstream system. For each order it pulls upstream status and updates `wp_orders` to match. On mismatch it retries until the write succeeds. This makes order state reliable.

Output:

> **Verdict:** **Block** — a nightly DELETE/UPDATE against the orders table with an unbounded retry, no tripwire, and no measurable "reliable" can corrupt order state with no way to know or stop it.
>
> **Findings:**
>
> | Loc | Pillar | Severity | What breaks | Cheapest fix |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | §3 | Diagnosable | Block | "retries until the write succeeds" is an unbounded loop | Add a 5-failure hard stop / 10-total cap, then dead-letter the order |
> | §3 | Blast | Block | Bulk overwrite of `wp_orders` is costly-to-one-way with no shield/tripwire | Run in observe mode first; add a row-count + mismatch-rate tripwire before any write mode |
> | §3 | Proof | Fix | "makes order state reliable" has no done-criterion | Define it: drift count → 0 across 3 consecutive runs, logged |
> | §3 | House (UTC) | Fix | "each night" has no timezone | Pin the schedule to UTC; document the local display offset separately |
> | §3 | House (write path) | Note | Reconciler is a second writer to `wp_orders` | Name the single write path, or gate the reconciler behind the same one |
>
> **Quick wins:**
> - [ ] Add the loop cap (§3) — one clause.
> - [ ] Pin "each night" to UTC (§3) — one word.
> - [ ] Replace "reliable" with the drift-count criterion (§3) — one sentence.

## What success looks like

The author sees, before any code exists, exactly where the plan is a wish rather than a build: the loop with no cap, the migration with no rollback, the task that can't prove it's done. The best outcome is a v1.x doc that ships fast *because* its risky parts were priced up front — not one that ships fast and pays later.
