# Git Worktree Safety Guide for Agents

> **Purpose:** Prevent destructive footguns when scripting with Git worktrees.  
> **Scope:** Shell scripts, CI pipelines, and agent workflows that create, manage, or clean up worktrees.

---

## 1. The "rm -rf worktree path" trap

**Anti-pattern:** Deleting a worktree by just removing its directory.

```bash
# WRONG — leaves stale metadata in .git/worktrees/
rm -rf ../feature-branch

# Also WRONG — git still thinks the worktree exists
git worktree remove ../feature-branch  # fails: "not a working tree"
```

**Why it's dangerous:** Git maintains metadata in `.git/worktrees/<name>/` and in a `.git` file inside the worktree. If you `rm -rf` the directory, you get:
- Orphaned metadata polluting your repo
- The branch may still be checked out according to git, blocking operations
- `.git/worktrees/<name>/index` can grow large and never gets cleaned

**Correct approach:**
```bash
# Always use git worktree remove
git worktree remove ../feature-branch

# If the directory is already gone, let git reconcile its own metadata —
# don't hand-delete .git/worktrees/<name> yourself:
git worktree prune

# If the worktree still exists but was moved/relinked and git can't find it,
# `repair` (Git 2.29+) is the documented fix, not manual surgery on .git/worktrees/:
git worktree repair ../feature-branch
```
Manual `rm -rf .git/worktrees/<name>` is a last resort for a clearly corrupt admin
stub that `prune`/`repair` won't touch — not the normal cleanup path.

---

## 2. Scripting `git worktree add` without failure handling

**Anti-pattern:** Assuming `git worktree add` succeeds.

```bash
git worktree add ../hotfix hotfix-branch
cd ../hotfix || exit 1
# ... do work ...
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Branch might already be checked out in another worktree (git refuses with "already checked out")
- Path might already exist
- Disk might be full
- Detached HEAD might not be what you expected

**Defensive version:**
```bash
if ! git worktree add ../hotfix hotfix-branch 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Worktree creation failed — branch may already be checked out or path exists" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

---

## 3. Trap cleaning worktrees with `rm -rf` and relative paths

**Anti-pattern:** The sibling of the `mktemp` bug — cleaning worktrees in traps.

```bash
WORKTREE="../feature-$(date +%s)"
git worktree add "$WORKTREE" feature-branch
trap 'rm -rf "$WORKTREE"' EXIT
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
- If `git worktree add` fails and `WORKTREE` is empty/malformed, a quoted `rm -rf "$WORKTREE"` errors on an empty string (`rm: missing operand`) rather than silently targeting cwd — but an *unquoted* `rm -rf $WORKTREE` word-splits an empty value to zero arguments, which for GNU `rm` is also a no-op/error, NOT an implicit `.`. The real risk isn't a specific "resolves to cwd" mechanism at all: it's that an unvalidated variable in a destructive trap can hold anything (a partial path, a stray `*`, a value from a prior failed `cd`) by the time `EXIT` fires, and nothing between assignment and the trap firing re-checks it
- If the script `cd`s into the worktree, the relative path `../` now points somewhere else
- `rm -rf` leaves stale metadata in `.git/worktrees/`

**Defensive version:**
```bash
# NOTE: unlike mktemp, git worktree add does NOT expand "XXXX" into a random
# suffix — that string would be used verbatim as the path. Build the unique
# path yourself before calling git, and don't rely on parsing git's output
# (--quiet suppresses exactly the text a naive script would try to awk out of it).
WORKTREE="$(pwd)/../feature-$$-$(date +%s)"
git worktree add "$WORKTREE" feature-branch || { echo "Worktree creation failed" >&2; exit 1; }
WORKTREE="$(cd "$WORKTREE" && pwd -P)"  # canonicalize AFTER validation

cleanup() {
    # --force here is NOT the §12 anti-pattern: this worktree was just created by THIS script for a
    # throwaway purpose and is being torn down in its own exit trap, not force-removed out from under
    # someone else's uncommitted work. §12's warning is about scripts reaching for --force to silence
    # an error on a worktree they don't own/didn't create.
    git worktree remove --force "$WORKTREE" 2>/dev/null || true
    git worktree prune 2>/dev/null || true
}
trap cleanup EXIT
```

---

## 4. Moving/renaming worktree directories outside of git

**Anti-pattern:** Using `mv` to relocate a worktree.

```bash
mv ../feature-branch ../feature-branch-old
```

**Why it's dangerous:** The `.git` file inside the worktree contains an absolute or relative path back to the main repo. Moving it breaks that link. Git now can't find the worktree, and `git worktree remove` fails.

**Correct approach:**
```bash
# git worktree move shipped in Git 2.17.0 — use it instead of mv
git worktree move ../feature-branch ../feature-branch-renamed

# Pre-2.17: remove and re-add
git worktree remove ../feature-branch
git worktree add ../feature-branch-renamed feature-branch

# If a worktree (or the main worktree) was ALREADY moved outside git's
# knowledge — e.g. via `mv`, a backup restore, or a renamed parent dir — the
# documented fix is `repair` (Git 2.29+), not manual .git-file surgery:
git worktree repair ../feature-branch-renamed
```

---

## 5. Assuming `main` (or any shared branch) is free for checkout

**Anti-pattern:** `git worktree add` for a branch that's already checked out elsewhere.

```bash
# Script adds a worktree for "main" to run tests
git worktree add ../main-worktree main
```

**Why it's dangerous:** If any other worktree already has `main` checked out, this fails. This is especially problematic in CI or multi-session environments.

**Defensive version:**
```bash
# Use a unique branch name or detached HEAD
git worktree add --detach ../test-run-$$ main

# Or check first — parse --porcelain, not human-readable output. The plain
# `git worktree list` format is not a stable API and grep can false-match on
# pathnames that happen to contain "[main]"-like substrings.
if git worktree list --porcelain | grep -qx 'branch refs/heads/main'; then
    echo "main is already checked out in another worktree" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

---

## 6. Garbage collection while worktrees exist

**Anti-pattern:** Running aggressive GC without considering worktrees.

```bash
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Worktrees share the same object database, and (with the exception of
  `refs/bisect`, `refs/worktree`, and `refs/rewritten`) the same refs — modern
  Git *is* worktree-aware and does scan all registered worktrees' refs/logs
  before pruning, so "gc can't see another worktree's refs" is not the
  mechanism
- The real documented risk is **concurrency**: `--prune=now` disables the
  normal grace-period safety margin, so if another process (a build in a
  linked worktree, a concurrent commit) creates an object that isn't
  referenced by a ref yet, `--prune=now` can delete it out from under that
  process — a race, not a worktree-visibility gap
- A secondary, worktree-specific risk: if a worktree directory was manually
  `rm -rf`'d without `git worktree prune`, its stale `.git/worktrees/<name>/`
  admin entry can leave git's bookkeeping out of sync with reality until
  pruned

**Defensive approach:**
```bash
# Always list worktrees before GC to understand what's shared
git worktree list

# Avoid --prune=now while any worktree might be mid-write (build, commit, checkout)
# Or avoid --prune=now entirely
git gc --auto  # conservative, safe
```

---

## 7. Deleting the main worktree's `.git` directory

**Anti-pattern:** Treating the main `.git` directory as just another git database.

```bash
# Thinking you're cleaning up an old clone
rm -rf .git
```

**Why it's dangerous:** All linked worktrees reference the main repo's object database via their `.git` files. Deleting the main `.git` irrecoverably breaks every linked worktree.

**Real-world scenario:** You have 3 worktrees off a main checkout. Someone decides to "clean up" by deleting the main checkout folder. Now all 3 worktrees are orphaned with no object database, and even `git log` fails.

**Precaution:**
```bash
# Before removing any repo, check if it's the primary for worktrees
git worktree list
# If other worktrees reference this one's objects, don't delete .git
```

---

## 8. Scripts that `cd` into a worktree then use relative paths back

**Anti-pattern:**
```bash
cd ../feature-branch
# ... do stuff ...
../../main-repo/some-script.sh  # fragile relative path
```

**Why it's dangerous:** The worktree is a separate directory. Your relative path `../../` assumes a specific directory layout that may not hold (the worktree could be anywhere on disk, not necessarily a sibling).

**Defensive approach:**
```bash
MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)"  # finds the shared .git
MAIN_ROOT="$(cd "$MAIN_REPO/.." && pwd)"        # parent of shared .git
```
Caveat: `"$MAIN_REPO/.."` assumes the standard "`.git` directory sits directly
under the repo root" layout. It breaks for repos using `--separate-git-dir`
or a bare common dir, where `.git` isn't a sibling of the working files. For
those layouts, don't derive the root by walking up from `--git-common-dir` —
resolve it explicitly (e.g. from `git worktree list --porcelain`, which
reports each worktree's actual path).

---

## 9. Assuming `git branch -D` on a worktree-occupied branch is dangerous the way you think

**Corrected claim:** Git actually protects you here — both `git branch -d` *and* `git branch -D`
(force) refuse to delete a branch that's checked out in **any** worktree, main or linked. This was
verified empirically (Git 2.50.1): `git branch -D feature-branch` fails with
`error: cannot delete branch 'feature-branch' used by worktree at 'PATH'` (exit 1). There is no
"force-delete succeeds and leaves that worktree in detached HEAD" failure mode — that was this
doc's own error, not a real Git footgun.

```bash
git branch -d feature-branch  # fails if checked out elsewhere
git branch -D feature-branch  # ALSO fails — Git blocks this even with -D
```

**What's still worth guarding against:** the actual footgun is scripts that treat this failure as
fatal-and-unexpected instead of handling it, or that work around it by first force-removing the
occupying worktree (`git worktree remove --force`) to clear the way — which *does* discard that
worktree's uncommitted work. If a script needs to delete a branch, check occupancy first and fail
loud rather than reaching for `--force` on the worktree to unblock the branch deletion:

```bash
if git worktree list --porcelain | grep -qx "branch refs/heads/feature-branch"; then
    echo "Branch is checked out in a worktree — aborting deletion (do not --force the worktree to work around this)" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

---

## 10. `git stash` is GLOBAL, not per-worktree — popping in the wrong worktree corrupts the wrong tree

**Corrected claim:** Stashes are **shared** across all worktrees via the single ref `refs/stash` in
the main repo's shared ref store — `git-worktree`'s docs list `refs/bisect`, `refs/worktree`, and
`refs/rewritten` as the only per-worktree ref namespaces, and `refs/stash` is not among them. This
was verified empirically: a stash pushed in the main worktree shows up identically in
`git stash list` run from a linked worktree.

```bash
# In worktree A
git stash push -m "WIP: half-done feature"

# In worktree B
git stash list  # shows the SAME stash — it is not worktree-local
git stash pop   # applies worktree A's stash onto worktree B's files — likely the WRONG tree
```

**Why it's actually dangerous:** because the stash is shared, popping it in the wrong worktree
applies changes meant for one branch/tree onto a different one — conflicts, or silent application
to unrelated files, and the stash is now consumed so worktree A can't get it back without digging
through the reflog (`git fsck --unreachable`, `git stash list` right after `pop` won't show it).

**Correct mental model:** Stashes are a single shared stack across the whole repo, indexed the same
way from every worktree. Use unmistakable `-m` messages, and run `git stash list` in the worktree
you're about to pop into (not the one you pushed from) to confirm which entry is `stash@{0}` before
popping.

## 11. Selective `.git` corruption & skeleton loss (the GH-177 scenario)

**What actually happened here (2026-07-07):** this repo's main `.git` directory lost `HEAD`,
`objects/`, `refs/`, and `index`, while `hooks/`, `worktrees/`, and `config` survived intact. This
is **not** the "someone ran `rm -rf .git`" scenario in §7 above — that deletes everything uniformly.
This was a *partial* loss (consistent with a selective backup/restore gap), and none of the 10
anti-patterns above describe it or would have helped diagnose it.

**Detection — verify before trusting a repo:**
```bash
# A healthy repo has ALL of these. Any missing = don't trust git commands here yet.
for f in HEAD objects refs config; do
    [ -e ".git/$f" ] || echo "MISSING: .git/$f"
done
git fsck --no-progress 2>&1 | head -5   # first real integrity check once the above pass
```
Also check `.git/worktrees/*/gitdir` stubs for staleness — a stub with no valid path behind it (or
just a bare `commondir` file and nothing else) is metadata cruft from the same class of incident,
not a real linked worktree; `git worktree prune` clears it once the main repo is healthy again.

**Recovery — in order, verifying before each destructive-looking step:**
```bash
# 1. git init is DOCUMENTED SAFE to re-run on an existing repo: it only fills in
#    missing standard files (HEAD, objects/, refs/, description, info/exclude,
#    sample hooks) and does NOT overwrite an existing config, hooks, or any
#    working-tree file.
git init

# 2. Repopulate history from the remote — additive only, does not touch the
#    working tree or local branch refs.
git fetch origin

# 3. Before pointing any local ref at origin, or touching the working tree,
#    build an index from the candidate branch WITHOUT checkout (read-tree does
#    not write to the working tree) and diff it against what's on disk:
git read-tree origin/main
git status   # compare — do NOT `checkout -f` / `reset --hard` / `clean` yet

# 4. Only once you've confirmed the working tree matches (or you've decided
#    what to do about genuine local divergence), point the branch ref at the
#    remote — this only writes a ref, still doesn't touch the working tree:
git update-ref refs/heads/main origin/main

# 5. Restore any tracked files that are genuinely missing/corrupted on disk
#    (confirmed absent or differing from origin, not local WIP) from the
#    remote's tree — scoped to just those paths, not a blanket checkout:
git checkout origin/main -- path/to/missing-file
```
The critical discipline: steps 1–3 are provably non-destructive to the working tree (`init` fills
gaps only, `fetch` writes only to `.git/objects` and remote-tracking refs, `read-tree` populates the
index without touching files). Do not reach for `checkout -f`, `reset --hard`, or `clean` until
you've diffed and know exactly what you'd be overwriting — those commands assume the working tree is
disposable, which after a partial-corruption incident it specifically is not.

---

## 12. Other footguns worth knowing before scripting worktrees

- **Untracked or modified files block `git worktree remove`.** It refuses if the worktree has any
  uncommitted changes; `--force` is required to proceed — and `--force` silently discards those
  changes. Never default a script to `--force` as a way to "fix" a remove that failed.
- **`git worktree move` does not support worktrees containing submodules** — the relative links
  back to `.git/modules/` break. Don't script a blind `move` without checking `.gitmodules` first.
- **`--force` on `add` / `move` / `remove` overrides the exact safeguards this guide teaches** (branch
  occupancy, dirty-worktree protection, path collisions). Treat any script that reaches for `-f`/`--force`
  to silence a worktree error as a signal to stop and understand *why* git refused, not a shortcut.
- **Lock worktrees on removable/unstable storage.** `git worktree lock <path>` prevents `git worktree
  prune` (including the prune that `git gc` can trigger) from reaping a worktree's metadata just
  because its directory is temporarily unreachable (unmounted drive, network share).
- **Prefer `git worktree list --porcelain` over the human-readable format** in any script. The
  plain-text table is not a stable API; porcelain output is machine-parseable and won't false-match
  on branch/path substrings the way a `grep` over the table can.

---

## Golden Rules for Worktree Safety

1. **Always use `git worktree remove`/`prune`/`repair`, never manual `rm -rf` or `mv`** on worktree
   directories or `.git/worktrees/<name>` — repair (2.29+) and move (2.17+) are git's own tools for
   exactly these cases
2. **Validate before destroying** — check that paths are non-empty, real directories, and not repo
   roots before any destructive operation
3. **Be path-aware in traps** — canonicalize paths early, validate them, and never `rm -rf` on
   relative paths or unvalidated variables
4. **The main repo's `.git` is the single source of truth** — protect it like a database, and verify
   its skeleton (`HEAD`/`objects`/`refs`/`config`) is intact before trusting any command run against
   it (§11); partial corruption is a real failure mode, not just total deletion
5. **Worktrees share almost everything — objects, refs, AND stashes/logs.** The only genuinely
   per-worktree ref namespaces are `refs/bisect`, `refs/worktree`, and `refs/rewritten`. Don't assume
   isolation you don't have (§10); Git also actively *protects* shared state you might expect it not
   to (§9's branch-delete block)
6. **Prefer git's own recovery tools over hand-surgery on `.git/`** — `init` (safe to re-run),
   `fetch`, `prune`, `repair` — and reach for `read-tree`/`diff`/`status` to inspect before any
   command that can overwrite the working tree (`checkout -f`, `reset --hard`, `clean`)
7. **Script against `--porcelain` output, never the human-readable table** — `git worktree list`'s
   plain format is not a stable, grep-safe API
